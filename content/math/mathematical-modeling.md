6. Model Refinement
   • Improve model based on validation results
   • Add complexity if needed
   • Iterate through process as necessary
```

### Modeling Principles

```
Occam's Razor: Prefer simpler models that explain the data adequately
"All models are wrong, but some are useful" - George Box

Key Considerations:
• Purpose: What questions should the model answer?
• Scope: What phenomena should be included/excluded?
• Scale: Temporal and spatial scales of interest
• Accuracy: Required precision for intended use
• Tractability: Mathematical solvability
• Interpretability: Can results be understood and explained?

Trade-offs:
• Realism vs. Simplicity
• Accuracy vs. Tractability  
• Generality vs. Specificity
• Detail vs. Insight
```

## Types of Mathematical Models

### Deterministic vs. Stochastic Models

```
Deterministic Models:
• Same inputs always produce same outputs
• Use differential equations, algebraic equations
• Examples: Newton's laws, population growth models

Stochastic Models:
• Include randomness and uncertainty
• Use probability distributions, random variables
• Examples: Stock prices, disease spread with uncertainty

Example Comparison - Population Growth:
Deterministic: dP/dt = rP (exponential growth)
Stochastic: dP = rP dt + σP dW (adds random fluctuations)
where dW represents random "noise"
```

### Discrete vs. Continuous Models

```
Discrete Models:
• Time/space divided into discrete steps
• Use difference equations, matrices
• Suitable for: populations counted in integers, time steps

Continuous Models:  
• Variables change smoothly over continuous domains
• Use differential equations, calculus
• Suitable for: physical quantities, large populations

Example - Compound Interest:
Discrete: A(n) = P(1 + r)^n (annual compounding)
Continuous: A(t) = Pe^(rt) (continuous compounding)
```

### Linear vs. Nonlinear Models

```
Linear Models:
• Variables appear to first power only
• Superposition principle applies
• Often easier to solve analytically

Examples:
• Spring force: F = -kx
• Linear population growth: dP/dt = r
• Linear regression: y = mx + b

Nonlinear Models:
• Variables raised to powers, multiplied together, in transcendental functions
• Rich, complex behavior possible
• Often require numerical solutions

Examples:
• Logistic growth: dP/dt = rP(1 - P/K)
• Pendulum: d²θ/dt² = -(g/L)sin(θ)
• Predator-prey: dx/dt = ax - bxy, dy/dt = cxy - dy
```

### Static vs. Dynamic Models

```
Static Models:
• Describe equilibrium or steady-state situations
• No time dependence
• Use algebraic equations

Examples:
• Supply and demand equilibrium
• Structural engineering stress analysis
• Optimization problems

Dynamic Models:
• Describe how systems change over time
• Include time as independent variable
• Use differential equations, difference equations

Examples:
• Population dynamics
• Chemical reaction kinetics  
• Economic growth models
```

## Basic Modeling Techniques

### Dimensional Analysis

```
Uses principle that physical equations must be dimensionally consistent

Process:
1. Identify relevant variables and their dimensions
2. Form dimensionless groups (π-terms)
3. Express relationships between dimensionless groups

Example: Pendulum Period
Variables: T (period), L (length), g (gravity), m (mass)
Dimensions: [T] = T, [L] = L, [g] = LT⁻², [m] = M

Dimensional analysis shows T = f(L/g) where f is dimensionless
Physical reasoning suggests T ∝ √(L/g)
Exact solution: T = 2π√(L/g)

Benefits:
• Reduces number of variables
• Guides experimental design
• Provides insight into scaling laws
```

### Conservation Principles

```
Many models based on conservation laws:
• Conservation of mass (continuity equation)
• Conservation of energy  
• Conservation of momentum
• Conservation of charge
• Conservation of species

General Form: Rate of Change = Input - Output + Generation

Example: Population Model
Rate of change = Births - Deaths + Immigration - Emigration
dP/dt = bP - dP + I - E = (b - d)P + (I - E)

Example: Heat Transfer
dT/dt = (Heat in - Heat out + Heat generated) / (mass × specific heat)

Example: Chemical Reactor
dC/dt = (Flow in × C_in - Flow out × C) / Volume + Reaction rate
```

### Scaling and Limiting Behavior

```
Understanding model behavior in extreme cases:

Small Parameter Analysis:
If ε << 1, expand solutions in powers of ε
Leading order behavior often provides key insights

Large Parameter Analysis:  
As parameter → ∞, what happens to solution?

Example: Damped Oscillator
m(d²x/dt²) + c(dx/dt) + kx = 0

Light damping (c small): oscillatory behavior
Heavy damping (c large): exponential decay
Critical damping: fastest return to equilibrium

Scaling reveals dimensionless groups:
ω₀ = √(k/m), ζ = c/(2√(km))
Behavior depends only on ζ, not individual parameters
```

## Population Dynamics Models

### Exponential Growth Model

```
Assumptions:
• Unlimited resources
• Constant birth and death rates
• No age structure

Model: dP/dt = rP
Solution: P(t) = P₀e^(rt)

Where:
• P(t) = population at time t
• P₀ = initial population  
• r = intrinsic growth rate (births - deaths per capita)

Properties:
• r > 0: exponential growth
• r < 0: exponential decay  
• r = 0: constant population

Applications:
• Early stages of bacterial growth
• Human population growth (historical periods)
• Radioactive decay (r < 0)
• Compound interest

Example: Bacteria doubling every 20 minutes
Doubling time: t_d = ln(2)/r
20 min = ln(2)/r → r = ln(2)/20 ≈ 0.0347 min⁻¹

After 2 hours: P(120) = P₀e^(0.0347×120) = P₀e^4.16 ≈ 64P₀
Population increases 64-fold
```

### Logistic Growth Model

```
Assumptions:
• Limited carrying capacity
• Competition for resources increases with population
• Growth rate decreases as population approaches limit

Model: dP/dt = rP(1 - P/K)

Where K = carrying capacity (maximum sustainable population)

Solution: P(t) = K/(1 + Ae^(-rt)) where A = (K - P₀)/P₀

Properties:
• S-shaped (sigmoid) growth curve
• Inflection point at P = K/2
• Approaches K asymptotically
• Maximum growth rate occurs at P = K/2

Phase Analysis:
• P < K: dP/dt > 0 (population increases)
• P = K: dP/dt = 0 (equilibrium)
• P > K: dP/dt < 0 (population decreases)

Applications:
• Population growth with resource constraints
• Technology adoption (S-curves)
• Tumor growth
• Market penetration

Example: Yeast Population
r = 0.5 day⁻¹, K = 1000, P₀ = 10

P(t) = 1000/(1 + 99e^(-0.5t))

At t = 0: P = 10
At t = 5: P ≈ 76
At t = 10: P ≈ 607  
At t = 15: P ≈ 950
As t → ∞: P → 1000
```

### Predator-Prey Models

#### Lotka-Volterra Model

```
System of two species: prey (x) and predator (y)

Assumptions:
• Prey grows exponentially without predators
• Predation rate proportional to prey × predator
• Predator deaths proportional to predator population
• Conversion efficiency from prey to predators constant

Model:
dx/dt = ax - bxy  (prey equation)
dy/dt = cxy - dy  (predator equation)

Where:
• a = prey growth rate
• b = predation efficiency  
• c = conversion efficiency
• d = predator death rate

Equilibrium: x* = d/c, y* = a/b

Properties:
• Closed orbits around equilibrium (periodic solutions)
• Conserved quantity: H = cx - d ln(x) + by - a ln(y)
• Oscillations with period ≈ 2π/√(ad)

Example: Lynx-Snowshoe Hare
Historical data shows ~10-year cycles
Parameters fitted to Canadian fur trade data
```

#### Modified Predator-Prey Models

```
Logistic Prey Growth:
dx/dt = ax(1 - x/K) - bxy
dy/dt = cxy - dy

Adds carrying capacity K for prey

Functional Response:
dx/dt = ax - (bxy)/(1 + bx/h) 
dy/dt = c(bxy)/(1 + bx/h) - dy

Saturating predation rate (Holling Type II)
h = handling time per prey item

Alternative Prey:
dx/dt = ax - (bxy)/(x + x₀)
dy/dt = c(bxy)/(x + x₀) - dy

Predators switch to alternative when main prey scarce
```

### Age-Structured Models

```
Leslie Matrix Model for discrete age classes:

n(t+1) = L n(t)

Where n(t) is vector of population in each age class
L is Leslie matrix:

L = [f₁  f₂  f₃  ...  ]
    [s₁  0   0   ...  ]
    [0   s₂  0   ...  ]
    [⋮   ⋮   ⋱   ⋮   ]

fᵢ = fertility of age class i
sᵢ = survival probability from class i to i+1

Long-term Growth Rate:
λ = dominant eigenvalue of L
• λ > 1: population grows
• λ = 1: stable population  
• λ < 1: population declines

Stable Age Distribution:
Given by dominant eigenvector of L

Example: Human Population
Age classes: 0-14, 15-44, 45-64, 65+
Fertility mainly in 15-44 group
Different survival rates by age
```

## Epidemic Models

### SIR Model

```
Compartmental model dividing population into:
• S(t) = Susceptible individuals
• I(t) = Infected (and infectious) individuals  
• R(t) = Recovered (immune) individuals

Assumptions:
• Total population N = S + I + R is constant
• Infection rate proportional to S × I (mass action)
• Recovery rate proportional to I
• No births, deaths, or migration during epidemic

Model:
dS/dt = -βSI/N
dI/dt = βSI/N - γI  
dR/dt = γI

Where:
• β = transmission rate
• γ = recovery rate
• R₀ = β/γ = basic reproduction number

Key Insights:
• Epidemic occurs if R₀ > 1
• Peak infection: I_max occurs when S = N/R₀
• Final size relation: S(∞) = S₀e^(-R₀(1-S(∞)/N))

Example: COVID-19 Early Dynamics
β ≈ 0.5 day⁻¹, γ ≈ 0.1 day⁻¹
R₀ ≈ 5, epidemic spreads rapidly
Interventions reduce β (masks, distancing)
```

### SEIR Model

```
Adds Exposed (E) compartment for incubation period:

dS/dt = -βSI/N
dE/dt = βSI/N - σE
dI/dt = σE - γI
dR/dt = γI

Where σ = 1/(incubation period)

More realistic for diseases with significant incubation time
```

### SIS Model

```
For diseases without immunity (S → I → S):

dS/dt = γI - βSI/N
dI/dt = βSI/N - γI

With S + I = N, reduces to single equation:
dI/dt = I(β - γ) - βI²/N

Equilibrium: I* = N(1 - 1/R₀) if R₀ > 1, else I* = 0

Applications:
• Common cold
• Bacterial infections  
• Some sexually transmitted diseases
```

### Network Models

```
Account for heterogeneous mixing patterns:

Rather than uniform mixing (mass action), consider:
• Contact networks (who interacts with whom)
• Spatial structure  
• Risk groups with different transmission rates

Example: Core Group Model
High-risk core group with high transmission
Low-risk population with lower transmission
Disease maintained in core, spills over to general population

Network Effects:
• Clustering: friends of friends are friends
• Degree distribution: some individuals have many contacts
• Small world: short path lengths despite clustering
```

## Mechanical and Physical Models

### Oscillatory Systems

#### Simple Harmonic Oscillator

```
Spring-mass system: F = ma
m(d²x/dt²) = -kx

Solution: x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ)
Where ω = √(k/m), A and φ from initial conditions

Properties:
• Period T = 2π/ω independent of amplitude
• Energy conserved: E = ½kA²
• Circular motion in phase space (x, dx/dt)

Applications:
• Mechanical springs
• Electrical LC circuits  
• Molecular vibrations
• Pendulum (small angles)
```

#### Damped Oscillator

```
Add damping: m(d²x/dt²) + c(dx/dt) + kx = 0

Characteristic equation: mr² + cr + k = 0
Discriminant Δ = c² - 4mk

Three cases:
1. Underdamped (Δ < 0): Oscillatory decay
   x(t) = Ae^(-γt) cos(ω_d t + φ)
   where γ = c/(2m), ω_d = √(ω₀² - γ²)

2. Critically damped (Δ = 0): Fastest return to equilibrium
   x(t) = (A + Bt)e^(-γt)

3. Overdamped (Δ > 0): Exponential decay without oscillation
   x(t) = Ae^(r₁t) + Be^(r₂t) where r₁, r₂ < 0

Quality factor: Q = ω₀/(2γ)
• High Q: lightly damped, many oscillations
• Low Q: heavily damped, few oscillations

Applications:
• Car suspensions (want critical damping)
• Building earthquake response
• Electronic circuits
```

#### Forced Oscillator

```
External driving force: m(d²x/dt²) + c(dx/dt) + kx = F₀cos(Ωt)

Steady-state solution: x(t) = A cos(Ωt - φ)

Amplitude: A = F₀/m / √[(ω₀² - Ω²)² + (2γΩ)²]
Phase lag: tan(φ) = 2γΩ/(ω₀² - Ω²)

Resonance occurs when Ω ≈ ω₀:
• Maximum amplitude transfer
• 90° phase lag at resonance
• Amplitude inversely proportional to damping

Applications:
• Musical instruments
• Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse
• Atomic force microscopy
• Magnetic resonance imaging
```

### Heat Transfer Models

#### Heat Equation

```
One-dimensional heat conduction:
∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²

Where:
• u(x,t) = temperature
• α = thermal diffusivity = k/(ρc)
• k = thermal conductivity
• ρ = density  
• c = specific heat

Boundary conditions:
• Prescribed temperature: u(0,t) = T₁, u(L,t) = T₂
• Insulated end: ∂u/∂x = 0
• Convective cooling: ∂u/∂x = h(u - T_ambient)

Solution methods:
• Separation of variables
• Fourier series
• Green's functions
• Numerical methods

Example: Rod with insulated ends
Initial condition: u(x,0) = f(x)
Solution: u(x,t) = Σ A_n cos(nπx/L) exp(-α(nπ/L)²t)

Heat diffuses, temperature profile smooths exponentially
```

#### Newton's Law of Cooling

```
Lumped parameter model for cooling object:
dT/dt = -h(T - T_ambient)

Solution: T(t) = T_ambient + (T₀ - T_ambient)e^(-ht)

Where h depends on:
• Surface area
• Heat transfer coefficient  
• Mass and specific heat

Time constant τ = 1/h characterizes cooling rate

Applications:
• Cooling coffee
• Body temperature after death (forensics)
• Electronic component cooling
• Food safety (refrigeration)

Example: Hot coffee cooling
Initial temperature: 85°C
Room temperature: 20°C  
h = 0.1 min⁻¹

After 10 minutes: T = 20 + 65e^(-1) ≈ 44°C
After 30 minutes: T ≈ 23°C
```

### Chemical Reaction Kinetics

#### First-Order Reactions

```
A → B with rate proportional to [A]:
d[A]/dt = -k[A]

Solution: [A](t) = [A]₀e^(-kt)

Half-life: t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k (independent of initial concentration)

Example: Radioactive decay
¹⁴C → ¹⁴N + e⁻ + ν̄
Half-life ≈ 5730 years
Used for carbon dating artifacts
```

#### Second-Order Reactions

```
A + B → C with rate proportional to [A][B]:
d[A]/dt = -k[A][B]

If [A]₀ = [B]₀ = a:
[A](t) = a/(1 + akt)

If [A]₀ ≠ [B]₀:
More complex solution involving difference in initial concentrations

No constant half-life (depends on concentration)
```

#### Enzyme Kinetics (Michaelis-Menten)

```
E + S ⇌ ES → E + P

Assuming fast pre-equilibrium:
v = V_max[S]/(K_m + [S])

Where:
• v = reaction velocity
• V_max = maximum velocity (when enzyme saturated)
• K_m = Michaelis constant (substrate concentration at v = V_max/2)

Behavior:
• Low [S]: v ≈ (V_max/K_m)[S] (first-order)
• High [S]: v ≈ V_max (zero-order, saturated)

Lineweaver-Burk plot: 1/v vs 1/[S] gives straight line
Used to determine K_m and V_max experimentally
```

## Economic Models

### Supply and Demand

#### Basic Market Model

```
Demand: Q_d = a - bp  (decreases with price)
Supply: Q_s = c + dp  (increases with price)

Equilibrium: Q_d = Q_s
a - bp* = c + dp*
p* = (a - c)/(b + d)
Q* = (ad + bc)/(b + d)

Consumer surplus = ½b(p_max - p*)²
Producer surplus = ½d(p* - p_min)²

Effects of shifts:
• Demand increase (a ↑): both price and quantity increase
• Supply increase (c ↑): price decreases, quantity increases
• Tax on suppliers: supply curve shifts up by tax amount
```

#### Market Dynamics

```
Price adjustment mechanism:
dp/dt = α(Q_d(p) - Q_s(p))

Where α > 0 is speed of price adjustment

Stability: If demand slope < 0 and supply slope > 0,
equilibrium is stable

Cobweb model (discrete time):
p_{t+1} based on Q_s(p_t)
Q_{t+1} based on p_{t+1}

Can lead to:
• Convergence to equilibrium
• Oscillations
• Divergent behavior
```

### Growth Models

#### Solow Growth Model

```
Production function: Y = F(K, L) = AK^α L^(1-α)
Where:
• Y = output
• K = capital stock  
• L = labor
• A = technology parameter
• α = capital's share (0 < α < 1)

Capital accumulation: dK/dt = sY - δK
Where s = savings rate, δ = depreciation rate

In per capita terms (k = K/L, y = Y/L):
dk/dt = sy - (n + δ)k

Steady state: k* = [sA/(n + δ)]^(1/(1-α))

Properties:
• Countries converge to steady-state income
• Growth rate depends on technology growth
• Savings rate affects level, not long-term growth rate
```

#### Innovation and Endogenous Growth

```
AK model: Y = AK (no diminishing returns to capital)
Growth rate: g = sA - δ

R&D-driven growth:
dA/dt = λA(research effort)

Human capital models:
Include education and skill development
Growth can be sustained through human capital accumulation

Network effects and increasing returns:
Value increases with number of users
Can lead to multiple equilibria and path dependence
```

### Financial Models

#### Black-Scholes Option Pricing

```
Stock price follows geometric Brownian motion:
dS = μS dt + σS dW

Where:
• μ = drift rate
• σ = volatility
• dW = random increment (Wiener process)

Option price V(S,t) satisfies:
∂V/∂t + ½σ²S² ∂²V/∂S² + rS ∂V/∂S - rV = 0

Boundary conditions for call option:
V(S,T) = max(S - K, 0)  at expiration
V(0,t) = 0  if stock worthless
V(S,t) ≈ S  for very large S

Solution: V = SN(d₁) - Ke^(-r(T-t))N(d₂)

Where N(x) is cumulative standard normal distribution
d₁ = [ln(S/K) + (r + σ²/2)(T-t)] / [σ√(T-t)]
d₂ = d₁ - σ√(T-t)

Greeks measure sensitivities:
• Delta: ∂V/∂S (hedge ratio)
• Gamma: ∂²V/∂S²
• Theta: ∂V/∂t (time decay)
• Vega: ∂V/∂σ
```

#### Portfolio Optimization

```
Markowitz mean-variance optimization:
Minimize risk: ½w^T Σw
Subject to: expected return ≥ target
            Σw_i = 1 (weights sum to 1)

Where:
• w = vector of portfolio weights
• Σ = covariance matrix of returns
• μ = vector of expected returns

Efficient frontier: trade-off between risk and return
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):
Expected return = risk-free rate + β × market risk premium

Risk parity:
Each asset contributes equally to portfolio risk
w_i × (Σw)_i = constant for all i
```

## Biological Models

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Single Compartment Model

```
Drug absorption and elimination:
dA/dt = -k_e A  (first-order elimination)

For oral dose D with absorption:
A(t) = (Dk_a/(k_a - k_e))[e^(-k_e t) - e^(-k_a t)]

Where:
• k_a = absorption rate constant
• k_e = elimination rate constant

Plasma concentration: C(t) = A(t)/V_d
Where V_d = apparent volume of distribution

Key parameters:
• Half-life: t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k_e
• Clearance: Cl = k_e V_d
• Bioavailability: F = fraction absorbed

Applications:
• Dosing regimens
• Drug interactions
• Individual patient optimization
```

#### Multi-Compartment Models

```
Two-compartment model:
Central compartment (blood) ⇌ Peripheral compartment (tissues)

dA₁/dt = -(k₁₀ + k₁₂)A₁ + k₂₁A₂
dA₂/dt = k₁₂A₁ - k₂₁A₂

Solution shows bi-exponential decay:
C(t) = Ae^(-αt) + Be^(-βt)

Where α > β are disposition rate constants
α represents distribution phase (fast)
β represents elimination phase (slow)

Used for:
• Antibiotics
• Anesthetics  
• Chemotherapy agents
```

### Allometric Scaling

```
Biological quantities scale with body mass:
Y = aM^b

Where:
• Y = biological quantity (metabolic rate, lifespan, etc.)
• M = body mass
• a = proportionality constant
• b = scaling exponent

Examples:
• Basal metabolic rate: b ≈ 0.75
• Heart rate: b ≈ -0.25  
• Lifespan: b ≈ 0.25
• Brain mass: b ≈ 0.75

Kleiber's law: Metabolic rate ∝ M^(3/4)
Surface area ∝ M^(2/3), so metabolism not limited by surface area

Applications:
• Drug dosing across species
• Ecological energetics
• Evolutionary biology
• Biomedical scaling
```

### Neural Models

#### Hodgkin-Huxley Model

```
Action potential in neurons:
C dV/dt = I - I_Na - I_K - I_L

Where:
• V = membrane potential
• I = applied current
• I_Na, I_K, I_L = ionic currents

Sodium current: I_Na = g_Na m³h(V - E_Na)
Potassium current: I_K = g_K n⁴(V - E_K)
Leak current: I_L = g_L(V - E_L)

Gating variables m, h, n follow:
dm/dt = α_m(V)(1-m) - β_m(V)m

Rate functions α, β are voltage-dependent
Derived from voltage clamp experiments

Model explains:
• Action potential shape and timing
• Refractory period
• Threshold behavior
• Propagation velocity

Simplified models (FitzHugh-Nagumo, Integrate-and-fire)
capture essential dynamics with fewer variables
```

## Environmental and Climate Models

### Greenhouse Effect

```
Energy balance model:
Incoming solar radiation = Outgoing thermal radiation

(1 - α)S₀/4 = εσT⁴

Where:
• α = planetary albedo (reflectivity)
• S₀ = solar constant ≈ 1367 W/m²
• ε = effective emissivity
• σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant
• T = effective temperature

Without atmosphere: T ≈ 255 K (-18°C)
With greenhouse gases: T ≈ 288 K (15°C)
Greenhouse effect: ΔT ≈ 33 K

Enhanced greenhouse effect from CO₂:
ΔT = λ Δln(CO₂)
Where λ ≈ 3 K per CO₂ doubling (including feedbacks)

Feedbacks:
• Water vapor (positive): warmer air holds more moisture
• Ice-albedo (positive): less ice → less reflection → more warming
• Cloud feedback (uncertain): complex effects on radiation balance
```

### Carbon Cycle

```
Box model with reservoirs:
• Atmosphere: ~850 GtC
• Ocean surface: ~1000 GtC  
• Deep ocean: ~38,000 GtC
• Vegetation: ~550 GtC
• Soils: ~1600 GtC

Flux equations:
dC_atm/dt = Emissions + Ocean→Atm - Atm→Ocean + Land→Atm - Atm→Land

Ocean-atmosphere exchange:
F = k(C_atm - αC_ocean)
Where α accounts for solubility and chemistry

Land-atmosphere exchange:
Photosynthesis: F_photo = β(CO₂)G(climate)
Respiration: F_resp = Q₁₀^((T-T₀)/10) × R₀

Where Q₁₀ ≈ 2 is temperature sensitivity of respiration

Airborne fraction: ~45% of emissions remain in atmosphere
Ocean and land act as carbon sinks, but saturation possible
```

### Population Ecology

#### Metapopulation Models

```
Population in patches connected by migration:
dp_i/dt = c_i p_i(1 - p_i) - e_i p_i + Σ_j m_ij p_j

Where:
• p_i = probability patch i is occupied
• c_i = colonization rate
• e_i = extinction rate
• m_ij = migration from patch j to i

Mainland-island model:
dp/dt = c(1 - p) - ep

Equilibrium: p* = c/(c + e)

Species persists if colonization > extinction

Spatial structure affects persistence:
• Corridor effects
• Edge effects
• Fragmentation impacts
• Conservation reserve design
```

#### Food Web Dynamics

```
Multi-species interactions:
dx_i/dt = f_i(x₁, x₂, ..., x_n)

Interaction matrix A with elements:
• a_ij > 0: species j benefits species i
• a_ij < 0: species j harms species i  
• a_ij = 0: no interaction

Stability analysis:
System stable if all eigenvalues of Jacobian have negative real parts

May's complexity-stability paradox:
Random large food webs typically unstable
But real food webs show structure that promotes stability:
• Weak interactions
• Compartmentalization  
• Non-random topology
```

## Model Validation and Analysis

### Sensitivity Analysis

```
How do model outputs change with parameter variations?

Local Sensitivity:
S_ij = ∂Y_i/∂p_j × p_j/Y_i (normalized partial derivatives)

Global Sensitivity:
Vary parameters over their full ranges
Use sampling methods (Monte Carlo, Latin Hypercube)

Sobol indices:
First-order: S_i = V(E(Y|X_i))/V(Y)
Total: S_Ti = E(V(Y|X_{~i}))/V(Y)

Where V = variance, E = expectation

Applications:
• Parameter estimation priorities
• Model simplification  
• Uncertainty quantification
• Robustness assessment

Example: Epidemiological model
If S_R₀ >> S_other, focus on estimating transmission parameters
If S_initial conditions high, need good initial data
```

### Uncertainty Quantification

```
Sources of uncertainty:
• Parameter uncertainty
• Model structure uncertainty
• Input uncertainty
• Numerical uncertainty

Probability distributions for parameters:
p(θ) based on prior knowledge and data

Bayesian updating:
p(θ|data) ∝ p(data|θ) × p(θ)

Propagation methods:
• Monte Carlo sampling
• Polynomial chaos expansion  
• Ensemble methods

Confidence/credible intervals for predictions
Prediction intervals accounting for all uncertainties

Example: Climate projections
Multiple models, parameter ensembles
Structural uncertainty from different physics representations
```

### Model Selection and Comparison

```
Information criteria for model comparison:
AIC = -2 log(likelihood) + 2k
BIC = -2 log(likelihood) + k log(n)

Where k = number of parameters, n = sample size

Lower values indicate better models
BIC penalizes complexity more heavily

Cross-validation:
Split data into training and testing sets
Fit model on training, evaluate on testing
k-fold CV: repeat with different splits

Bayes factors:
B₁₂ = p(data|M₁)/p(data|M₂)
Ratio of marginal likelihoods

Model averaging:
Weight predictions by model probabilities
Accounts for model uncertainty

Practical considerations:
• Purpose of model (prediction vs. understanding)
• Computational cost
• Interpretability
• Extrapolation requirements
```

### Identifiability Analysis

```
Can model parameters be uniquely determined from data?

Structural identifiability:
Mathematical question - given perfect, noise-free data
Analyze using:
• Taylor series coefficients
• Similarity transformations
• Differential algebra

Practical identifiability:  
Given realistic data with noise and limited observations
Use:
• Fisher Information Matrix
• Profile likelihood
• Bootstrap confidence intervals

Non-identifiable parameters:
• Remove from model (structural)
• Fix at reasonable values
• Use prior information (Bayesian)
• Collect more informative data

Example: Two-parameter exponential model
y = ae^(-bx)
If only late-time data available, a and b not separately identifiable
Product ab may be identifiable
```
